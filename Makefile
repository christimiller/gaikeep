# GAIKeep Makefile - Defines automation tasks for building, testing, and running the GAIKeep application.

# *** Building ***

all: clean test build run  # This target depends on completing clean, test, build, and run steps before running the application.

# Build
# Compiles the Go code and places the app in the bin directory, then makes it executable.
# For more information on the 'go build' command, see the official docs: [https://go.dev/doc/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies]
# For how the Go compiler works, including building for multiple targets: [https://go.dev/doc/compiler]
build:

# Test
# Runs unit tests for the GAIKeep application
# For more information on the 'go test' command, see the official docs: [https://go.dev/doc/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages]
test:
	@echo "Running tests..."
	@go test -v -cover ./internal/... && \

# Clean
# Removes any previously built artifacts
# For more information on the 'rm' command, see the man page: [https://linux.die.net/man/1/rm]

# Setup
# Prepares the project environment (assuming Go is installed)

# For more information on the 'go get' command, see the official docs: [https://go.dev/doc/cmd/go/#hdr-Download_and_install_packages_and_dependencies]
